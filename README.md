# AcmeDogFood

Purpose of the project was to display Dog and Cat food info via Handlebars templates from a firebase reference on demand.

This requires jQuery, Handlebars, Bootstrap, and Firebase. Install these with 'bower install' into a /lib/ directory.

Run the http-server in the AcmeDogFood directory, point your browser to http://192.168.33.10:8080/# and click the buttons. See the food, sizes, and prices.

none of this will change the fact that your cat will never love you and that you'll probably watch your dog die. Buy Acme!
